				<h1>About Me</h1>
				<p>
					My name is Dan Smith, and I've always felt that where my name lacks in
					excitement, I have to make up for in personality, so here is my chance
					to let that personality shine in my personal website.
				</p>
				<hr />
				<p>
					I am an adventurous soul with a child-like nature. I love comic books
					and particularly Spider-Man comics that I have read since I was a kid.
					My first software development app that I ever created using HTML, CSS,
					and JavaScript was a trivia app about the legend himself.
				</p>
				<hr />
				<p>
					I also love to travel and speak several languages such as Italian,
					French, and Spanish. I have lived in countries where those languages
					are spoken and traveled to many more. While in Graduate School to
					become a teacher I won the original iPhone from a travel blog I wrote
					back in the summer of 2007 and continued to write more to that blog
					because I find it fun and therapeutic. (travel blog coming soon)
				</p>
				<hr />
				<p>
					I also ride my bike as a predominant means of transportation, partly
					to save money on other means of travel, but mostly to reduce my carbon
					footprint. I recently moved to Denver, Colorado in order to enjoy a
					new adventure in life and I can't wait to get a mountain bike so I can
					add new blog posts to my travel experiences as I find new trails to
					ride on in the outdoorsy city and state.
